stop:
restart:

docker run: combination of create and start
	-use -it or container will stop automatically

rm: delete container
images: displays all images
rmi: removes docker image

***********AGILE************
Agile:
-stories have points
-stories with points >5 could be subdivided into multiplr stories

Epic:
-group of stories
-defines feature

Sprint:
-time of completion of stories
- similar to ganttchart?

Velocity:
- speed of completion of stories
- either use avg time/sprint or points/sprint to determine velocity of a project

***********************Jira***************************

JIRA is a tool used for bug tracking, issue tracking, and project management.

JIRA Scheme:
Inside JIRA scheme, everything can be configured, and it consists of
Workflows
Issue Types
Custom Fields
Screens
Field Configuration
Notification
Permissions

JIRA Issues:
basically bugs or problems in a project
Issue Type displays all types of items that can be created and tracked via JIRA. 
JIRA Issues are classified under various forms like new feature, sub-task, bug, etc

-Default Issue Type Scheme: In default issue type scheme all newly created issues will be added automatically to this scheme
-Agile Scrum Issue Type Scheme: Issues and project associated with Agile Scrum will use this scheme

JIRA Components:
sub-sujescts of a project
-break up the projects
-like features, teams, modules, subprojects and more. 
-we can generate reports, collect statistics, and display it on dashboards and so on.

JIRA Screen:
-each issue is transitioned under a field called screen
-Issue Attributes encompasses
+Statuses
+Resolutions
+Priorities

Issue Security Schemes:
Permission Schemes allow you to create a set of permissions and apply this set of permission to any project.

Subtask:
-split parent issue to smaller task
-can create issue under both parent and subtask
-can't subtask a subtask
-a parent with subtask can't be converted to subtask

Workflows:
